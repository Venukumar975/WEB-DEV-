1 .                ************ What to use 'let / const ' for grabbing html elements ************

   Using `const` for grabbign elements is preferred becoz using let comes with its own problems like FOr eg; say we use let heading = document.getElementById("heading")
   and in future there is a high chance for someone to use the same variable name heading for assigning another data {array,object,string,int,Bigint}, heading = "Welcome" and this will overwrite over previous initialisation
   and we cant do any furhter DOM manipulations using `heading` variable .

2 . When using import / export keywords in modules of our project , We need to specify type = "module" attribute in the <script/> tag along with `src` attribute.Since EC6 script supports modularity in js

3 . EC6 script ---> ECMAS Script which was introduced in 2015 and supports modularity in js like import/export , arrow-functions , and many more.....

4 .            ************** About Centering an div element **************

   This is important , to know about how to center our div elements in css . Our web browser knows infront the actual width of our body or screen-size(viewport) so centering an div horizontally is easy , we can simply use `margin-left:auto ; margin-right:auto` and our browser takes
   care of centering it horizontally since it knows the actual max-width it just subtracts the `width of div element` (note : if u have'nt specified the width for an div element it takes the complete space from left to rigth u can check this by giving it a bordre initially ) and allocate spaces on left and right equally.

   But this approach fails for vertical alignment { margin-top : auto ; margin-bottom : auto } this one fails to center our div element .
   Cuz Our browser doenst know the actual height of our page. How so u might have this doubt since it  knows the width why not height? right so the problem is the height is never fixed unlike width (depends on device like pc , phone) , when we open any website what we do for navigation we either click buttons or ``scroll up or down`` so when we are scrolling and after if u add more info to it vertically
   the hegith again changes so thats why u cant make ur browser remember the heihgt property , Also go and learn about 'vh' variant of 'px'(not variant but they have some connection or similarity)

   So for the sole purpose of centering our containers like div there are some special css layout algo's like " flex-box ,......." Using them we can do this 


5 . Note the inbuilt constructors in js start with Capital letter For eg, Object() , Date() , Array() , Math() , Number()
    Number() - used to convert a string to Number

6 . Math.random() always gives values in between (0,1) so if u want to produce random `integers` from 0 to 11 u should use;
    Math.floor(Math.random()*11)  since the max value it can give u is 11.9999999 u should use floor same goes for min-value.
