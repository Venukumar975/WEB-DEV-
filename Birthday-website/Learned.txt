Hello 
This is What I learned from this Project

                                             *** HANDLING FLEX BOX  ***
div
    div
        item1
        item2
        item3
    /div
/div

The above code builts us a container having 3 items (think of them as emojis or a img ) , Now by default our div shows them as stack of items
which are top of each other so if u want to display them like side by side (item1 item2 item3) u must use flex BOX
{
    display : flex;
}

This helps us to acheive showing these items side by side but they will be very close , so now u can move them to the extreme left or right or at the center
by using another parameter called justify-content also u can add space between them using this.
{
    display : flex;
    justify-content : center;
}
And if u want these items to move in vertical direction use align-items
{
    display : flex;
    justify-content : center;
    align-items : end;
}

The above css makes sure that the items are placed side by side and are at the center of the container and touches the bottom of the container

### Now if u want to do all of these actions but while stacking them on top of each other , We should use something called ""flex-direction"
it has 2 val's ( row or col ) by def it is row so if u change it into col then the functionalities of justify-content and align-items gets reversed

**** Note : justify-content and align-items only work withing a flex box not for div 
{
    justify-content : center;
    align-items : end;
}                                ---- This wont work since u havent mentioned flex;



                         *** linear- gradient ****

This is a css function applied for background, background :linear-gradient()
here it takes 2 arguments ;
first one is the color we want to start with and 2nd is the color that our 1st
color fades into
